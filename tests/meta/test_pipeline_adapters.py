"""BNT / SUB / THR: the three I/O paths that feed the FILING axis.

Every event that can move a row towards VERIFIED FIXED enters through one of
these scripts, and all three had the same shape of defect: an untyped result.

  * bounty.py never checked an HTTP status, so a 401 was byte-for-byte the
    same as an empty tracker -- an expired key read as the vendor having
    closed every report.
  * submit.py wrote every POST into submissions.json regardless of status,
    lost the record entirely on a timeout, and aborted the rest of the batch.
    Report #55 exists on their server and did not exist in our log, and the
    reconciliation was done by hand.
  * thread.py built the correspondence by scanning directories with
    `delivered` defaulting to True, so moving a file into archive/ deleted a
    vendor reply and three reported findings.

They talk to the platform through httpx.MockTransport here. Nothing in this
file makes a live request.

Fails at 38d48ed: none of classify_read, submit_batch or ingest exist.

# THR -- retired 2026-09-06, with the mechanism it guarded
#
# test_delivery_defaults_false_and_ingest_is_once held scripts/thread.py's
# ingest(): moving a message into archive/ must not delete a vendor reply, and
# an outbound message counts as delivered only when somebody said so. Both are
# real incidents and the test was right about them.
#
# ingest() is gone. Nothing called it -- not the sweep, not render.py, not the
# module's own __main__ -- and the workflow it served, correspondence pasted
# into inbox/ by hand, was tried once in round one and never again. A guard
# over a code path that no longer exists does not protect anything; it just
# asserts that a deleted function still behaves.
#
# The incident cannot recur because the mechanism cannot run. If messages are
# ever ingested from files again, restore this test in the same commit as the
# code -- it names exactly what goes wrong. Correspondence now arrives through
# the bounty API alone (scripts/bounty.py), which has its own guards.
